                                    as the skills and experience I've learned along the way, and also help more

                    Hi, I'm Anila! and I have a kitten, Mimi.
                    <br>
                    I am passionate about website development, and enjoy learning and pursuing technology!
                </p>
                <br> 
                <h5>My childhood..</h5>
                <p>
                    I grew up in a tea village with limited learning and living resources. Due to the
                    relationship between the economy and family, I live independently, while studying and doing
                    housework taking care of my younger siblings. My goal since I was a child is to let my family live a
                    better and happier life and to have more ability to give back to society and help more people, thus
                    I kept learning and growing through various challenges.
                </p>
                <br> 
                <h5>After graduating from middle school..</h5>
                <p>
                     I went to Taipei to study in the data processing department at
                    Shihlin of Commerce, I learned a lot about Computer Science and Computer Architecture from school,
                    and at that time I also got acquainted with web design. In a special seminar, I took the initiative
                    to organize a four-person development team to jointly develop a website promoting my hometown-tea
                    specialties. With the combination of team creativity and technology, we won first place in the
                    Taipei National Primary and Secondary School Special Webpage Competition Second place and broke the
                    school's winning record.
                </p>
                <br> 
                <h5>During my college years..</h5>
                <p>
                    I was admitted to the university of my first choice - the Department of Information and
                    Financial Management, Taipei University of Technology. In addition to
                    studying diligently, I also served as an officer of the Student Association for three years. I
                    enthusiastically contributed to the campus and also served as a student councilor and student
                    representative to help promote the awareness of student rights and attach importance to student
                    rights. In addition, I have actively volunteered in the national information community and served as
                    a committee member of the programming club, helping host over 50 courses, seminars, and study groups
                    on programming. Besides, I self-learned web programming, develop websites for professors, and
                    contribute to the open source in the community!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Outside of schoolwork, I was active in internships. I was admitted as an international intern at デリモ
                    Co., Ltd., However, due to the epidemic outbreak, the internship program was forced to cancel, thus
                    I switched to working as a front-end development intern at an electronics manufacturing company. I
                    taught myself the vue.js framework to develop a real-time data dashboard for Accton Technology INC.
                    And in a team of ten people, responsible for the leader of the frontend, led the team
                    from scratch to realize the entire project goal and achieve a satisfaction rate of 97%, and has been
                    appreciated and complimentary by the team members and supervisor!
                </p>
                <br> 
                <h5>After graduating with first place in university..</h5>
                <p>
                    I joined a digital financial insurance company as a
                    data analyst. Also as an office Python lecturer, actively share and promote programming concepts.
                    Besides, I used my spare time to build my blog and designed my personal website using TailWind CSS,
                    also taught myself React and TypeScript, and made some side projects. With my passion and love for
                    web development, I decided to turn a page in my life and develop my career as a front-end engineer.
                    and joined WorkLife In Japan as a frontend engineer.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In order to make better products while enjoying development, I am constantly accumulating my skills
                    and experience, and I also hope to share the knowledge and techniques I have learned along the way
                    with more and more people. I look forward to making more contributions along the way, and even
                    organizing book clubs or exchanges to gather people interested in learning technology and knowledge.
                    Help more people through my little power!
